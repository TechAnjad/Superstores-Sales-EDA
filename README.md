# Superstore Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Superstore sales dataset.
The project aims to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to inform data-driven decision-making for Superstore.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Superstore sales dataset, sourced from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting ]
## Analysis

The EDA covers the following areas:

* **Sales Performance:**
    * Overall sales trends and seasonality.
    * Sales by region, category, and customer segment.
    * Top-performing products and categories.
* **Customer Behavior:**
    * Customer segmentation and demographics.
    * Purchase frequency and average order value.
    * Shipping preferences and delivery times.
* **Product Analysis:**
    * Product performance and profitability.
    * Product category analysis.
* **Regional Analysis:**
    * Sales performance by region and state.
    * Identification of key markets.
* **Shipping Analysis:**
    * Shipping mode analysis and preferences.
    * Delivery time analysis and potential bottlenecks.

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis was conducted using the following tools and technologies:

* **Python:**
    * Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    * NumPy: Numerical computations.
    * Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.
    * Scikit-learn and Statsmodels: Statistical modeling .
* **Tableau:** Dashboard creation and interactive visualization.

## Key Findings

    * The West region is the top-performing region in terms of sales.
    * Standard Class shipping is the most popular option, but exhibits high variability in delivery times.
    * The Technology category generates the highest revenue, with Phones and Accessories being the top performers.
    * Customer segmentation reveals distinct shipping preferences and purchase behaviors.

## Recommendations

    * Prioritize inventory and marketing efforts for Technology products in the West region.
    * Investigate and improve Standard Class delivery times to enhance customer satisfaction.
    * Develop targeted marketing campaigns and pricing strategies for each customer segment.
    * Optimize inventory management for peak seasons to maximize sales.

## Future Work

    * Conduct a customer profitability analysis.
    * Develop a predictive model for sales forecasting.
    * Integrate external data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
    * Enhance the interactive dashboard with additional features.
